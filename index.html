      <p class="why-bowhead-section-description">
        The name “Bowhead” embodies two guiding principles of our philosophy: <br><br>
Survival of Capital: Inspired by the Bowhead whale, known for its remarkable longevity, our approach emphasizes resilience and the avoidance of permanent capital loss.<br> <br>
Unwavering Focus: Drawing from the Indian epic, the Mahabharata, we embrace the lesson of Arjuna, who, during the Archery lesson, saw only the eye of the sparrow, when others were distracted by the surroundings. For us, successful investing demands the same clarity and singular focus - identifying what truly matters and executing with clarity and discipline.<br><br>
Together, these values form the foundation of our approach - focussed and built for the long term.
